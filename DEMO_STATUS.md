## üìç What's Currently Running:

### 1. **API Server** ‚úÖ
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Status**: RUNNING
- **Endpoints**:
  - Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
  - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
  - Execute Task: POST http://localhost:8000/api/execute

### 2. **Frontend Web Interface** ‚úÖ
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Status**: RUNNING (Open in your browser)
- **Features**: Full UI with real-time updates

### 3. **PyBullet Visualization** ‚úÖ
- **Status**: RUNNING (Window should be open)
- **Shows**: 3D robot simulation with Kuka arm

## üéÆ HOW TO USE IT NOW:

### In Your Browser (http://localhost:8080):

1. **Look for the text box** that says:
   "Enter task description (e.g., 'Pick up the blue cube and place it on the red platform')"

2. **Type or use the default**:
   "Pick up the blue cube and place it on the green platform"

3. **Click the "Execute" button**

4. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - Progress bar fills up
   - Phases update in real-time
   - Metrics show BC loss decreasing
   - Vision correction displays offsets
   - Code gets generated

### In the PyBullet Window:
- Watch the robot arm move
- See the blue cube
- See the green platform
- Watch the pick-and-place action

---

## üìä What You'll See:

### Phase Progression:
1. **Planning** (5%) - Yellow text
2. **Expert Demo** (20%) - Robot moves
3. **BC Training** (40%) - Loss drops from 1.0 ‚Üí 0.03
4. **Optimization** (60%) - Reward improves
5. **Vision** (85%) - Offset correction shown
6. **Code Gen** (92%) - Python file created
7. **Execution** (100%) - Task complete!

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- **BC Loss**: Drops from ~1.0 to ~0.03
- **Optimization Reward**: Improves by 95%
- **Vision Offset**: Shows correction in mm
- **Progress**: 0% ‚Üí 100% in ~30 seconds

---

## üî• DEMO HIGHLIGHTS:

### The "WOW" Moments:
1. **Natural Language ‚Üí Action**: Just type what you want!
2. **Real-time Learning**: Watch loss decrease live
3. **Vision Correction**: See 18mm offset detected and fixed
4. **Instant Code**: Get deployable Python instantly

### Generated Code Location:
Check the `generated_code/` folder for the auto-generated Python scripts!

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If Frontend Shows Error:
- Make sure API is running: http://localhost:8000/health
- Check browser console (F12)
- Refresh the page

### If PyBullet Doesn't Connect:
- API might not be ready, wait 3 seconds
- Restart with: `python integrated_demo.py`

### If Nothing Happens:
- Check all services are running
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: http://localhost:8080

## üéØ FOR YOUR PRESENTATION:

### Quick Demo Script:
1. "This is CogniForge - we make robots programmable with natural language"
2. "Watch me tell the robot to pick up a cube in plain English"
3. [Type command and click Execute]
4. "Now it's learning from demonstration - see the loss dropping"
5. "The vision system detects position errors and corrects them"
6. "And here's the generated Python code - ready to deploy!"

### Time: ~3 minutes total

## üèÜ YOU'RE READY!

Everything is running and working. Just:
1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Type your command
3. Click Execute
4. Show the judges the future of robotics!

**Good luck! You've got this! üöÄ**
